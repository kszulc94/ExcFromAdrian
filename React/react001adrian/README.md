React Excercise
- Initial release - navbar and container with cards - contents from JSON
- UPDATE (11.05.2023): 
a) Move Bootstrap's 'Card' from App.jsx to a separate component
b) Implement App.scss instead of .css, use Mobile First method
c) Create Environment Variables (.env) files (also for development environment - .env.dev); added "start:dev" for env dev mode in package.json (to use development/test mode => "npm run start:dev")
d) Change Bootstrap's "Container" to "Container Fluid" in heading/navbar section
e) General code cleaning and removing unused files and code lines
